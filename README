# topSU3

This repository is a `julia` package to analyze data coming from `HiRep` pure gauge simulations 



## Analysis workflow

### Data input and formatting
- `analysis/data_input/*`: data are being read from HiRep raw files. A first filters of doublers and incomplete runs is done. Data are then being stored in a formatted `jld2` file 
- `analysis/diagnostics/*`: Inside the same ensemble, different flow types are compared and we found which are the missing configuration for which kernel

### Scale setting and primary observables
- `analysis/primary/*`: in `data_analysis.jl` we compute primary observables: t0,t1,t2,\chi,\chi_round. We dump the data into a `.bdio` file like
```
dump_data_dic(scales, "RESULTS/apr4_scales"  ; keys=["ensemble","flow_type","L","obs","ref"], values=["t0"])
dump_data_dic(top   , "RESULTS/apr4_topology"; keys=["ensemble","flow_type","L","scheme"], values=["χ","χround"])
```
> To read the data, you have to feed the `reconstruct` routine with the SAME keywords args `keys` and `values` given to `dump_data_dic`
> ```
> scale = reconstruct("RESULTS/apr4_scales.bdio"  , keys=["ensemble","flow_type","L","obs","ref"], values=["t0"])
> topol = reconstruct("RESULTS/apr4_topology.bdio", keys=["ensemble","flow_type","L","scheme"], values=["χ","χround"])
> ```
